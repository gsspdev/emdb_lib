//# Special Phoneme Clusters
//
//Capitalize to Indicate an -er Syllable
//
//(24) Capitalize the first syllable of the root-word to indicate that it is followed by a sound (usually a syllable) such as -er, -der, -ter or -ther. This is one of the most unique Principles of Speedwriting and it is often misunderstood by visitors who are merely glancing at the rules in a shallow manner.
//
//The word “author” can be written with the single letter A because lower-case a represents the ah/aw/au sound at the beginning, and capitalizing the letter represents the thor syllable at the end!
//
//```
//lo = low               or = or
//Lo = lower             Or = order
//byl = boil             Wa = water
//Byl = boiler           A = author
//```
//
//Note: Because the symbol for the “sh” sound (Z) is already an uppercase letter, words that begin with “sh” cannot use Principle 24.
//
//```
//Zv = shave             Zvr = shaver
//Zu = shoot             Zur = shooter
//```
//
//Symbols for Various Sound Clusters
//
//(38) Write an upper-case S to express the sound of str- and also to express syllables like ‘ster, stir, stur.’
//
//```
//Sa = stray
//mnS = monster
//kSnj = consternation
//rSj = restoration
//```
//
//(23) Write a comma to express the “st” sound at the end of a word.
//
//```
//bl, = blast
//fmo, = foremost
//```
//
//(43) Write the letter s to express “st” in the middle of a word.
//
//```
//ds- = distant
//psl = pistol
//```
//
//Note on the application of Principles 15, 23 and 43: In “thirst” and “yeast” the comma represents the final “st.” In “thirsty” and “yeasty,” the “st” is considered medial rather than final, so it is written with s and the comma represents the “ee” sound at the end of the word.
//
//```
//th,  =  thirst
//ths, =  thirsty
//y,   =  yeast
//ys,  =  yeasty
//```
//
//(76) Write the letter f to express the syllable -for-, -fer-
//
//```
//rfmj = reformation
//mtf = metaphor
//Tf = transfer
//fv- = fervent
//```
//
//(79) Write the letter x to express -aks-, -ex- or -ox-
//
//```
//xd- = accident
//x, = exist
//xjn = oxygen
//txkol = toxicology
//```
//
//(106) Write Me to express -meter- or -metri- / -metro-
//
//```
//Mek = metric
//klMe = kilometer
//Meno = metronome
//```
//
//Omitting Letters from Selected Sound Clusters
//
//(44) The letter n is omitted when it is followed immediately by -cial, -ch, -j, -shun. Principles 44 and 37a both govern words ending in -nans, -nens, etc.
//
//```
//fnx = financial        cj = change
//trc = trench           kvj = convention
//ord/ = ordinance       mnc/ = eminence
//```
//
//(45) The letter t is omitted after the sound of k, p, x.
//
//```
//lku = lecture
//rp = rapt
//mxu = mixture
//```
//
//(101) Omit the letter d when it occurs right before j, m, v.
//
//```
//ajq = adjunct
//amj = admission
//av-u = adventure
//```
//
//(94) In words of more than one syllable, write the following abbreviations of initial sounds:
//
//```
//b to represent “br”
//f to represent “fr”
//g to represent “gr”
//k to represent “cr/kr”
//t to represent “tr”
//h to represent “hor-”
//```
//
//```
//bv; = brevity          bgde = brigadier
//fq- = frequent         fvlx = frivolous
//gvta = gravitate       gnlj = granulation
//ks- = crescent         ktsz = criticise
//tql = tranquil         tpdj = trepidation
//hzn = horizon          hsbk = horseback
