//## Phrasing
//
//Groups of words— especially short, common words— may be written together without spaces between them. This process is called phrasing. It increases the speed of writing/typing but makes reading the notes more difficult.
//
//An unnumbered Principle from the textbook Foreword: “The beginner will find it best to make short phrases at first for that will make for ease in reading as well as writing.”
//
//(4) When “as” is repeated in a phrase, omit the letter a from “as.”
//
//```
//slgs = as long as
//sbgs = as big as
//```
//
//(12) Omit the word “and” from common phrases like “over and over” and “again and again.”
//
//```
//agag = again and again
//LoLo = lower and lower
//```
//
//(72) Proper nouns (the names of people and places) should be separated from other words in a sentence. Do not phrase them.
