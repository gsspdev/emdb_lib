//## Word-building Rules
//
//(11) A “word-sign” is a pre-determined abbreviation for a common word. Whenever two word-signs or a word-sign and another syllable can be combined to express another word, you should do so.
//
//```
//trf   =  tr + f   =  therefore
//wkpl  =  wk + pl  =  workplace
//dti   =  d + ti   =  daytime
//```
//
//(13) Write numerals (digits) to express all numbers except for “one.” The Speedwriting Dictionary seems to contradict this textbook Principle by listing ways to spell out the numbers, for example svntnt for “seventeenth” nnt, for “ninety.”
//
//```
//onwa st = one-way street
//nad or 2 = in a day or two
//```
//
//(18) The past tense -ed and the present participle -ing are simply omitted from verbs in most cases. Context makes the verb’s tense or aspect clear and including the d or g in the shorthand code might actually make it more likely to be misinterpreted as some entirely different word.
//
//```
//iv wk he bf. = I have worked here before.
//ru do l? = Are you doing well?
//```
//
//The 1927 multi-volume edition of the textbook offered some examples of when to include d to indicate the past tense or g to indicate the -ing participle. Here are updated versions of those examples:
//
//```
//wk s g f u. = Work is good for you.
//wkg s g f u. = Working is good for you.
//```
//```
//tgf u rse as aci ul nv fgt.
//= The gift you receive as a child you will never forget.
//tgf u rsed as aci ul nv fgt.
//= The gift you received as a child you will never forget.
//tgf uv rse as aci ul nv fgt.
//= The gift you have received as a child you will never forget.
//```
//
//(27) To add -s (plural or present tense suffix) to a shorthand word that ends with a punctuation symbol, repeat that symbol.
//
//```
//k/ = card              k// = cards
//t- = tent              t-- = tents
//kl' = class            kl'' = classes
//```
//
//(35) Use ‘standard abbreviations‘ whenever you can:
//
//```
//co for “company”
//NY for “New York”
//```
//
//The textbook uses the old-fashioned abbreviation no for the word “number.” If you would prefer to write that word according to normal Principles, you would write Nmb
//
//The Speedwriting Dictionary offers write-by-Principle alternatives for many of the abbreviations used in the textbook. For example, the dictionary indicates that “city” may be written phonetically as s; or using the textbook abbreviation of C
